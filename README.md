# Optical Bouncer

A simple augmented reality game made with Matter.js and OpenCV.

## Introduction

Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information. This simple game uses computer vision to achieve the illusion of AR and allow players to control the game by moving real objects. This game is also built with Matter.js which is a JavaScript 2D rigid body physics engine for the web. Visit the website at <a href="https://ziyizhu.me/optical-bouncer/">Optical Bouncer</a>.
